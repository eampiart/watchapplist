# Apple Watch Apps

This personal project lists some of my "essential" Watch apps. It's intended as a quick intro for *someone special* getting an Apple Watch.

The colors correspond to a Watch with "Antique White" strap and the size "38mm".

The screenshot carousel uses Slick with special settings and CSS modifications.

The data was cached with the help of [getAppDetails](http://eampiart.github.io/getappdetails) [(on GitHub)](https://github.com/eampiart/getappdetails).

The list of apps is generated using JavaScript/jQuery, form two JSON files.

The website is optimized for an iPhone 6.

The project was also mainly done to deepen my knowledge in various JavaScript techniques and "fiddle around" ðŸ˜‰

*Feel free to use any part of this project*
